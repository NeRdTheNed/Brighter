# Brighter

A Minecraft mod that increases the maximum brightness configurable in the video settings from 100% to 1000% allowing pitch black areas to appear as if under daylight.

Also available from https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/brighter .

Note that the brightness display text still goes from 0% to 100% but all values are internally multiplied by 10. The maximum brightness in vanilla Minecraft becomes 10%.
